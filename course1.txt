1st course - useful tools, troubleshooting essentials, Linux & cPanel basics
====================

Useful tools
---------------
	live server (CSF is not installed by default nor is it bundled with cPanel)
	SSH client (MobaXterm, Putty, Cygwin, ...)
	online courses (Linux Academy, RHCSA, LPI, ...)
    expendable server (local/virtual server via VirtualBox, VMware, KVM, ...) 
		[clone a fresh server as a template first, instead of installing new ones all the time]

Troubleshooting essentials
---------------
	ID the client (is it spam? 3rd party contact/abuse dept. from another company? Ex client? Sub/resold account? Any previous contact?)
    establish what the problem is ("my Email won't work", "my site is down")
    locate the account/server (Domain valid? Site exists on the server? DNS resolving properly?)
	access the server
        replicate the issue (CAUTION: 
		whenever possible, make sure your actions are reversible, mv/cp instead of rm, backup everything affected, caution when renaming/reassigning domains)
        notate/document (concise > verbose, add your own comment)
        following up on tickets
	search for solutions online before escalating

Linux and cPanel basics + tasks to get you going
---------------
	install any Linux distribution from scratch (CentOS, RHEL, Ubuntu, ...)
	log into your local server via SSH
	print something to the command line
	install vim
	run vimtutor
	create a file
	find a file
	install ConfigServer Security & Firewall
	locate a file (yum whatprovides locate, updatedb)
	create an alias (for example: tail a certain log file, clear screen + switch to home folder)
	install full LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)
		install a web server (Apache, Nginx)
			create a custom landing page (text/HTML only, /usr/share/httpd/noindex/, /var/www/html/info.php)
		install a database server (MySQL, MariaDB)
		install a CMS manually (WordPress, Joomla, Magento, Drupal, ...) 
  obtain your own domain (this will allow you to learn about DNS resolution/propagation, have your own Email, FQDN, etc.)
	create a cPanel account
	set up custom nameservers and DNS
	create your own web site
	block your IP
	unblock your IP via another IP/VPN or the VM console (Tor browser has one built in, so it's ideal)
	(ideally: host a live website)
